# Store Project 
In This Project I used The well-know Frame work ReactJs with Redux 
### Main Idea of This Project 
 we are going to display Items in Home page and in each Item there are  one link and two button 

1. The Link is going to navigate you to another page where you can find more info on this Item . also you will find in bottom another Items that 
have the same categories . 
2. 1. The First Button is Save Button let's say that the user isn't sure if he wants to buy They Item or not well he can put it in save page which is going to display all the Items that she/he displaid . 
2. 2. The Second and The Final Button is going to represent Buy Button where is going to put an item in buy Item page and it's going to show how 
quantities you show in
